## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the **LeetCode 75** study plan, a curated collection of essential coding problems designed to help developers master fundamental algorithms and data structures. The LeetCode 75 study plan is widely recognized as one of the most effective ways to prepare for technical interviews and strengthen coding skills.

### 🎯 What is LeetCode 75?

The LeetCode 75 study plan is a carefully selected set of 75 coding problems that cover:
- **Array & String** manipulation
- **Two Pointers** technique
- **Sliding Window** problems
- **Stack** and **Queue** operations
- **Linked List** algorithms
- **Tree** traversals and manipulations
- **Graph** algorithms
- **Dynamic Programming** concepts
- **Binary Search** techniques
- **Backtracking** algorithms
