## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Code Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
   ```java
   // Always validate inputs
   public int solution(int[] nums) {
       if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
           throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input array cannot be null or empty");
       }
       // Process safely
   }
   ```

2. **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets**
   ```java
   // ❌ Bad: Hardcoded values
   private static final String API_KEY = "sk-1234567890";
   
   // ✅ Good: Use environment variables or configuration
   private static final String API_KEY = System.getenv("API_KEY");
   ```

3. **Safe String Operations**
   ```java
   // Use StringBuilder for string concatenation in loops
   StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
   for (String item : items) {
       result.append(item);
   }
   ```

4. **Resource Management**
   ```java
   // Always close resources
   try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file)) {
       // Process file
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // Handle exception
   }
   ```

#### Git Security Practices

1. **Never Commit Sensitive Data**
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore
   .env
   *.key
   *.pem
   config/secrets.json
   ```

2. **Use Signed Commits**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   ```

3. **Review Changes Before Committing**
   ```bash
   git diff --cached
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

### For Repository Maintainers

#### Access Control

1. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Restrict pushes to main branch

2. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - All maintainers must enable 2FA
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Consider using password managers

3. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Review dependencies monthly
   - Update dependencies promptly
   - Monitor for security advisories

#### Dependency Management

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   # Check for outdated dependencies
   npm audit
   # or for Java projects
   ./gradlew dependencyUpdates
   ```

2. **Use Dependency Scanning**
   - Enable GitHub Dependabot
   - Configure security alerts
   - Review and merge security updates

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### GitHub Security Features

#### 1. **Enable Security Advisories**
- Go to repository Settings → Security
- Enable "Security advisories"
- Enable "Dependabot alerts"

#### 2. **Configure Branch Protection**
```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml
name: Branch Protection
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  security-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Security Scan
        run: |
          # Add security scanning tools
          echo "Running security checks..."
```

#### 3. **Set Up Security Workflows**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run security scan
        run: |
          # Add your security scanning commands
          echo "Security scan completed"
```

### Code Quality Gates

#### 1. **Static Analysis**
```java
// Use tools like SpotBugs, PMD, or SonarQube
// Example SpotBugs configuration
@SuppressWarnings("PMD.AvoidHardCodedCredentials")
public class SecurityExample {
    // Code with security annotations
}
```
