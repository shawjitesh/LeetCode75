# Branch Protection Workflow - REMOVED
# This workflow was causing issues and has been temporarily removed
# It can be re-added later once the basic setup is working properly

# The original branch protection workflow has been disabled to resolve PR failures
# Future improvements can include:
# - Simplified branch protection rules
# - Better error handling
# - Non-blocking security checks
